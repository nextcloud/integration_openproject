# Smoke Testing Docs for `integration_openproject`

This file consists of some smoke testing to be done before the release (major and minor) of `integration_application` application.
The need for this smoke testing (manual) is that we do not have e2e test setup to automate that involves both `OpenProject` and `Nextcloud`.
