Feature: API endpoint for direct upload

  As an OpenProject user
  I want to upload files to Nextcloud from inside OpenProject
  So that I don't need to leave OpenProject, open Nextcloud and then search for the same work package to create a link.

  As an OpenProject admin
  I want the OpenProject front-end to send the files directly to Nextcloud
  So that the long requests for uploading don't block any resources on the OpenProject back-end.

  Background:
    Given user "Carol" has been created
